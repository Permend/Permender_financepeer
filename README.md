# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: npm start

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The authentication is done using google firebase authentication system. 
Here a new user can signup with mailid and password (**min 6 character long**)

Loggin will take one to the home page where the user can upload the file and the file will be stored in firebase storage. 


Work still remaining : 
I am unable to fetch the data seperately from json file. 

Once it is fetched, it can be displayed on screen using crud operation or useeffect tools.
